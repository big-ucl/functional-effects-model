A repository to evaluate RUMBoost on panel dataset. Specifically, we learn individual-specific constants from the socio-demographic data to effectively output a panel RUMBoost model.


MODELS TODO:

baseline: MNL with only AS variables

Random intercept: to mention in the literature

Functional intercept: Done for RUMBoost, hyperparameter search for TasteNet-MNL / LMNL

Random rslope model: literature

Functional slope model: Rumboost with same idea than heart, TasteNet-MNL

Potentially model with both?
