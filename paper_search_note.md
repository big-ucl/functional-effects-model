4. Data selection in machine learning for identifying trip purposes and travel modes from longitudinal GPS data collection lasting for seasons
    * Not panel data, GPS trajectory data
5. Predictors of driving cessation in community-dwelling older adults: A 3-year longitudinal study
    * Data not directly openly available. May be if contact the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs but not clear if it would be free or not

# TITLE ( "panel data" OR "panel effects" OR "longitudinal" ) AND EXACTSRCTITLE ( "choice modelling" )

1. Longitudinal investigation of skeletal activity episode timing decisions – A copula approach
    * Not applicable, investigate correlation between activity start time and duration.

    * Data not available
3. Estimating installed-base effects in product adoption: Borrowing IVs from the dynamic panel data literature
    * Simulated data
4.  Using panel data for modelling duration dynamics of outdoor leisure activities
    *  Relevant - waiting to access data to dutch mobility panel
    *  OK
5. Estimation of an unbalanced panel data Tobit model with interactive effects
    * Potentially ok but need to register to the Chinese Family Panel Studies
6.  Triggers of behavioral change: Longitudinal analysis of travel behavior, household composition and spatial characteristics of the residence
    * Data old and doesn't seem to be easily accessible. Potentially ok.

1. Look before you leap: Earnings gaps and elderly self-employment
    * Not panel.
2. Exposome Determinants of Quality of Life in Adults Over 50: Personality Traits, Childhood Conditions, and Long-Term Unemployment in SHARELIFE Retrospective Panel
    * Not using easySHARE.
3. ProInsight: A Tool for Risk Prediction and Impact Evaluation of Digital Health Solution Implementations
    * Not choice related. Extrapolation of longitudinal factors over the waves with cubic B-splines.
4. Functional Graph Convolutional Networks: A Unified Multi-task and Multi-modal Learning Framework to Facilitate Health and Social-Care Insights
    * Use og GCN to do regression/classification or forecast on multimlongitudinal factors. Not really relevant in our case
5. A New Computationally Efficient Algorithm to solve Feature Selection for Functional Data Classification in High-dimensional Spaces

    * OK
    * Use of wave 5 and 6 to analyse mental health. Some variables from SHARE, some from easySHARE, seems reproducible and used a mixed effect model so relevant
7. The effects of COVID-19-era unemployment and business closures upon the physical and mental health of older Europeans: Mediation through financial circumstances and social activity
    * Not interested in COVID-19, not the focus of our model.
8. Conditional on the Environment? The Contextual Embeddedness of Age, Health, and Socioeconomic Status as Predictors of Remote Work among Older Europeans through the COVID-19 Pandemic
    * Not interested in COVID-19, not the focus of our model.
